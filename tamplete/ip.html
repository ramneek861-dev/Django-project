<br>
<p><b>Welcome to our Intelliguard Cyber IP Scanning page, where we Think of IP address scanning like a detective work for computers. It helps cybersecurity experts figure out what devices are connected to a network and whether they're safe or risky. By checking IP addresses one by one, they can find out which computers are active and what services they're running. This helps them spot any potential weak spots that hackers might use to break in. But, it's important to do this carefully and responsibly, following rules to avoid accidentally causing problems for the network.

<p><b>In cybersecurity, an IP (Internet Protocol) address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. IP addresses serve two main purposes: identifying the host or network interface and providing the location of the device in a network.Here's an overview of how URL scanning works in the context of Intelliguard cyber:</b></p>

    <center><h3>Identification</h3></center> 
 IP addresses are like unique identifiers for devices connected to a network. They help in identifying the source and destination of data packets in a network. This is crucial for cybersecurity as it allows security systems to track and monitor network traffic.</div>

<div class="card shadow animated-border">
 <center><h3>Logging and Monitoring</h3></center> 
<p>Security devices such as intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) use IP addresses to log and monitor network traffic. By analyzing IP addresses and associated metadata.</p>

    <div class="card shadow animated-border">
    <center><h3>Access Control</h3></center>
      IP addresses are often used in access control mechanisms. They're essential in access control mechanisms like firewalls, enabling the filtering of traffic based on source or destination IP addresses to prevent unauthorized access and potential security breaches.

    <center><h3>Threat Intelligence</h3></center>
     <p> IP addresses are a key component of threat intelligence feeds. Security professionals use threat intelligence to stay updated about known malicious IP addresses, domains, or other indicators of compromise (IOCs).</p></div>
