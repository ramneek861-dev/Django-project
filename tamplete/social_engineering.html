        <h2 class="text-info">Understanding Social Engineering Awareness</h2>
        <p>Social engineering awareness is crucial for recognizing and mitigating the risks associated with social engineering attacks. Here are some key concepts to understand:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Social Engineering Tactics:</strong> These are techniques used by attackers to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.</li>
          <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> This is a common social engineering tactic involving fraudulent emails, messages, or websites designed to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information or downloading malicious content.</li>
          <li><strong>Pretexting:</strong> In this tactic, attackers create a fabricated scenario or pretext to gain the trust of their targets and extract valuable information.</li>
          <li><strong>Impersonation:</strong> Attackers may impersonate legitimate individuals or organizations to deceive their targets and manipulate them into taking desired actions.</li>
          <li><strong>Physical Security:</strong> Social engineering attacks are not limited to digital channels and may also exploit weaknesses in physical security measures to gain unauthorized access to facilities or information.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>By understanding these concepts and remaining vigilant, individuals and organizations can better defend against social engineering threats.</p>
